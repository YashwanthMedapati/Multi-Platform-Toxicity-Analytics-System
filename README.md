# Cloud_Crawlers01 Project 3

## Overview
This project is an analytics dashboard built on Streamlit that compares and analyzes toxicity trends on Reddit and 4chan.  The dashboard offers extensive toxicity analysis features, like community-level toxicity comparisons, AI topic monitoring and temporal analysis to analyze social media material

### Temporal Activity Analysis
the temporal activity analysis examines trends and posting patterns over time on reddit and 4chan and a time bucketed post counts and average toxicity can be obtained via the getpostspertime function and  the gettemporalsummary function will provide the total postings for the chosen date range and weekdayvsweekendstats function examines posting frequency by day. postlengthovertime function will track the average post length over the time finally the rendertemporal function creates interactive line and bar charts for post volume toxicity trends and oversees the entire temporal panel and executing all queries

### Toxicity Comparison
toxicity comparison module analyzes toxicity across communities including reddits subreddits and 4chan boards, getthecommunities function collects all communities and normalizes names for cross platform comparison  and  gettoxicity function computes average toxicity and distributions for histogram plotting. rendertoxicity function manages the full panel by taking user inputs for date range platforms communities and metrics then visualizing results via histograms and summary statistics we can select multiple metrics including toxicity severe toxicity insult profanity identity attack threat and unsubstantial scores for detailed comparisons

### AI Topic Analysis
The toxicity and mentions of AI topics like ChatGPT are tracked by the AI topic analysis module a cross platforms such as 4chan and reddit and  t he getaitopics function accumulates activity over the chosen period range and searches posts for keywords to get time-lapsed post counts and toxicity scores after that a  summary table including the total posts, average toxicity, maximum toxicity and median toxicity for every platform topic pair is generated by the getsummarytable function. to  allow users to manage the entire analysis panel  the renderaitopic function collects user selections, retrieves topic data, and plots trend and   summary table, box plots, and line charts for post counts and average toxicity are the examples of visualizations that use individual post values rather than averages to display the whole distribution of toxicity scores across topics and platforms

## How to run this Project 
fisrt Login to the server using the command 
```ssh -L 8501:localhost:8501 username@Ip```
I am loggin in using the above comand bcos once i run the streamlit application i can easily access it in the browser usinf the
http://0.0.0.0:8501 url bcos in server only port 80 is accessable to outside world and iam already running the faktory on that port.

once you logged in clone the github repo , replace the repolink with the actual link
```git clone repolink```

once you cloned make sure you have the python installed and all the required packages as been used in this project is in the requirements.txt 
you can use this command 
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

once all the requirements are installed you can use the below command to run ths project
```python -m streamlit run main.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501```
this will expose the application on port 8501 in the chrome we can use the link like http://0.0.0.0:8501 to access the dashboard
